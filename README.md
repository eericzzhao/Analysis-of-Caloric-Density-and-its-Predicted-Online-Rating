# Analysis of Caloric Density and its Predicted Online Rating

This project investigates the relationship between the nutritional profile of a recipe (specifically calories, sugar, and fat) and its subsequent user rating on **Food.com**. By analyzing these metrics, we aim to determine if caloric density is a reliable predictor of a recipe's perceived quality.

## 1. Introduction & Motivation
With the steady rise in restaurant prices, home cooking has shifted from a hobby to a financial necessity for many households. However, home recipes are often non-standardized, making user reviews the primary compass for determining if a dish is "worth it."

Our team is exploring what specifically makes a recipe successful. Does a high-calorie "comfort" dish naturally garner better reviews, or do users prefer lighter options?

### The Research Question
> **"Can we predict whether a recipe will receive an above-median rating based on its caloric density and other nutritional markers (sugar and fat)?"**
